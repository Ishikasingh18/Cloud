App service setup for SAM app :


For SAM, taking reference of RMC app 








Taking the template from RMC C  & merge into SAM



No changes required till row 1 to 26, same template & config for all apps






for row 32 -34 --> 
Docker_registry_server_url
subscription --> resource group
ACR name is same for all environment

no need to give hardcore value as it is define under pipeline --> nprd.yaml





For now, docker image is latest

no need to give hardcore value as it is define under pipeline --> nprd.yaml

from line 37--80 , no changes
it runs on container image
app service means app code deploy kroge like docker image build kia (we can't deploy docker image) --> so we pushing this image through ACR --> app service reads the image and pick the latest image from ACR

In SAM app:
App service --> app code docker image --> ACR --> app service -- app

In OBF app:
App service --> App code Tomcat Java 17 --> app service -- app


Now cross check the subnet delegation as given below & run the pipeline with stages: app service nprd apply & run --









Now execute the pipeline :






Also select application insight NPRD run & apply before running pipeline

We can't enable application insight manually as given below 




Under networking --->



 enable all this & apply 





Now identity - true




Add the resource group in identity :




Go to ACR --> Identity --> status : on for all




Add the access control for each of the 3 for ACR



Now it will reflect like this ;



This settings which we set above are seen in app setting as given below :




Subscription --> nprd rg --> Under config --> FTP state : all allowed and save . 
Remember : watever the changes done in config, the app service restart automatically at each time
