		1. Connect direct must be ndm user sudo su - ndm
		2. Check if connect direct is running or not
		3. Ps -ef | grep ndm  ### cdpmgrprocess must be running 
		4. 
	 
		5. Next check if Connect console is up and or running or not 
		6. Location : /opt/app/ndm/cdunix/ndm/bin>./direct  
	 ## It can be used to transfer the file 
	## Check the status if already executed process 
 

 
Example :  Transfer file CBP to CBP node only ( self-transfer )
 

 
 
Snode = your local node and if you want to tranfer file to destination server then snode will become destination snode name
 
===========================================================
sub do_copy process snode=exclmnprd01
step01 copy
from
(
file=/opt/app/ndm/test.txt
pnode
)
to
(
file=/opt/app/ndm/received.txt
snode
)
pend;
=======================================================
Pnode to snode ( FROM  -->  TO )
 
		7. How to check local snode of the current server 
 

 
Transfer file CBP to CBP node only ( self-transfer )
 

 
Process number will be generated 
 

 

 
 
To check last executed process 
 
Sel stat pnum=7 det;
 

Error :
 

 
So it mean it is not added out netmap.cfg file and search with message id XIPT004I in this example

----------------------
 
		8. Configuration files:
 
Location 
 

 
Netmap.cfg file:
 
		1. Whenever we are the sender update the netmap.cfg file
		2. Whenever we are the receiver then userfile.cfg needs to be updated
		3. As we have secure + setup then either of the case we have to update netmap.cfg file for both sender and receiver )
 
Let's consider we are the sender then destination snode and FQDN with NVA port  ( NVA port for out bound interfaces 
Let's consider we are the receiver in the below same example then destination snode and FQDN with 1364 default port 
 

 
 
Whenever we update netmap.cfg file we need to sync the configuration 
 

 

 
sync netmap path=/opt/app/ndm/cdunix/ndm/cfg/prmcbpprod01/netmap.cfg name=*;
